Title: A Thought on OO Inheritance

From the very start, I wasn't really a big fan of the object-oriented
(OO) paradigm. Not because I have extensive experience with OO and
experienc to prove that it isn't really a very good idea, I
attribute it two things. First, is that I have used Python as my
main language for so many years and Python is very flexible when it
comes to which paradigm you use. I notice that most of the time
except for the use of objects from libraries, I primarily use the
modular approach. Another reason is that years ago, I read Eric S.
Raymond's Art of Unix Programming. It was really very insightful and
one of the things that it discussed is the failure of the OO
paradigm. If I remember it correctly, it said that OO is good for
some application domains like UI development, otherwise it isn't
really a very good idea.
